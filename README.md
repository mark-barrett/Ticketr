Ticketr is a ticket sales platform for any type of event, it allows Event Owners to start selling their tickets, while it let's Event Goers re-sell their tickets safely on the Ticketr website. Ticketr is written using Python on the Django framework, and is accompanied by its own Android app for Event Owners to scan tickets at the doors of their events, and also a REST API, which can be used to create future applications for event listings, and also handles authentication with the Android App.
