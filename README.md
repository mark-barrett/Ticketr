Ticketr is a ticket sales platform for any type of event, it allows Event Owners to start selling their tickets, while it let's Event Goers re-sell their tickets safely on the Ticketr website. All payments are handled through PayPal, and when a user purchases a ticket a pdf and qrcode are generated for the user, that will be scanned upon arriving to the event to check the validity of the ticket. When reselling a ticket, a user can only ask for the price they paid (ticket face value), or less. Ticketr is written using Python on the Django framework, and is accompanied by its own Android app for Event Owners to scan tickets at the doors of their events, and also a REST API, which can be used to create future applications for event listings, and also handles authentication and ticket checking in/validating with the Android App.

I really enjoyed making Ticketr. It gave me a chance to learn a brand new language on my own, and also allowed me to become more familiar with how REST api's work. How HTTP requests are sent and recieved, and ultimately it has helped my understanding of OOP. I'm happy I choose this because it let me mix two different applications (web app and android app) together, even though they are written in different languages. It allowed me to find out how applications like this commnunicate with eachother and how information is sent around the web.
